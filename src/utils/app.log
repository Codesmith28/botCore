**Bhakhari Recipe:**
- Traditional Gujarati flatbread made with whole wheat flour and semolina

**Cheese Sandwich Recipe:**
- Assembles bread, cheese, and butter or mayo

### Bhakhari Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1/4 cup semolina (optional, for extra crunch)
- 2 tbsp oil or ghee
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Warm water (as needed)
- Ghee or oil for cooking

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Dough:**
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, semolina (if using), salt, and oil or ghee. Mix well to incorporate the fat into the flour. Gradually add warm water, little by little, and knead into a firm and smooth dough. The dough should not be too soft. Cover and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

2. **Divide and Roll:**
   Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Roll each ball between your palms to smooth it out. Using a rolling pin, roll out each ball into a thick disc, about 4-6 inches in diameter. The bhakhari should be thicker than a regular chapati or roti.

3. **Cook the Bhakhari:**
   Heat a tawa (griddle) or a flat pan over medium heat. Place a rolled-out bhakhari on the hot tawa. Cook for about 1-2 minutes, then flip. Apply a little ghee or oil on the top surface, press lightly with a flat spatula, and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Flip again and apply ghee or oil on the other side. Continue pressing and cooking until both sides are golden brown and crispy. The bhakhari should be well-cooked and crispy.

4. **Serve:**
   Remove the bhakhari from the tawa and place it on a plate. Serve hot with ghee, yogurt, pickles, or any curry of your choice.

Bhakhari is a traditional Gujarati flatbread that pairs well with various dishes. Enjoy it with your favorite accompaniments!

his improved implementation does the following:

We define a Command interface in a separate types file, which ensures that all command modules have a consistent structure.
We use a Collection from discord.js to store our commands. This is a more efficient data structure for looking up commands by name.
When loading commands, we now use require instead of dynamic imports. This is simpler and works well for this use case.
We check if each command module has both data and execute properties before adding it to our collection. This helps catch errors early if a command file is misconfigured.
When registering commands with Discord, we use the toJSON method on the command data, which is the correct way to serialize the command for Discord's API.
In the interaction handler, we simply look up the command in our collection and execute it if found. This is more straightforward and type-safe.

### Bhakhari Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1/4 cup semolina (optional, for extra crunch)
- 2 tbsp oil or ghee
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Warm water (as needed)
- Ghee or oil for cooking

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Dough:**
   In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, semolina (if using), salt, and oil or ghee. Mix well to incorporate the fat into the flour. Gradually add warm water, little by little, and knead into a firm and smooth dough. The dough should not be too soft. Cover and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.

2. **Divide and Roll:**
   Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Roll each ball between your palms to smooth it out. Using a rolling pin, roll out each ball into a thick disc, about 4-6 inches in diameter. The bhakhari should be thicker than a regular chapati or roti.

3. **Cook the Bhakhari:**
   Heat a tawa (griddle) or a flat pan over medium heat. Place a rolled-out bhakhari on the hot tawa. Cook for about 1-2 minutes, then flip. Apply a little ghee or oil on the top surface, press lightly with a flat spatula, and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Flip again and apply ghee or oil on the other side. Continue pressing and cooking until both sides are golden brown and crispy. The bhakhari should be well-cooked and crispy.

4. **Serve:**
   Remove the bhakhari from the tawa and place it on a plate. Serve hot with ghee, yogurt, pickles, or any curry of your choice.

### Simple Cheese Sandwich Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or your favorite type)
- 2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your choice)
- 1-2 tbsp butter or mayonnaise
- Optional additions: tomato slices, lettuce, pickles, mustard, etc.

   Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, on a plate or cutting board. Add the cheese slices on top. If you're adding any optional ingredients (like tomato slices or pickles), layer them on top of the cheese. Place the second slice of bread on top, buttered side up.
